+ Began to read through Chapter 1 of the Romanowska, Wren, & Crabtree book
	+ Got stuck on understanding the pseudocode 
		+ Took 30mins, then came back and tried to explain what i was reading to my fiance. Her eyes glazed over but it clicked for me!
	+ Made a button
	+ defined procedures
	+ Tried to create turtles, nothing appears
		+ I had an extra "end" at the end of my setup procedure
+ WOAH THE TURTLES ARE MOVING
