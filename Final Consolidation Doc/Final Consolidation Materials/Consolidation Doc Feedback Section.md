- Week 7: "Do you see any points of connection between what the exercises were trying to achieve, and the issues raised in these readings?"
	- The following quote from *Avatars, Monsters, and Machines: A Cyborg Archaeology* by Colleen Morgan resonated with me:
	_Successful ventures into cyborg interpretation should not be a seamless, transhuman integration of machine and body to transmit ideas about the past, but should invoke a monstrous disruption, interfering with both our understanding of the past and current sense of self._
	Using agent based models to "simulate" or model the past is absolutely a monstrous disruption of our understanding of the past and present. As Dr. Graham has said in the week 5 general feedback, "The past doesn’t exist: there’s only those things we find in the here-and-now, so what gets counted…. counts." So if the past doesn't exist, then is a carefully defined agent based model of the past just as or more valid than the historical narrative stitched together by historians and archaeologists based on the evidence available to them?
- In the first consolidation document I set a goal and was encouraged to embrace the collaborative aspect of our work. Though I had trouble keeping to a consistent schedule and making use of discord, I did use annotations from my peers to enhance my perspective on the material
	- For example, [this](https://hyp.is/K-QE5POLEeq_5suM9daqnw/digitalpressatund.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/5_1_kersel.pdf) annotation also resonated with how we use topic models. As Mahanoor Riaz mentions, it is always helpful to have more tools to analyze a dataset. Topic models allow us to break up and view the data in a way we have not seen it before, which can provide new insights. 
	- Another example of my use of annotations was when I tried to spark some friendly debate about the ownership of artifacts:https://hyp.is/9HtFxDCPEeyXuS8rVyewhg/www.sapiens.org/archaeology/archaeology-diversity/ (My Pseudonym is saltypasta)
