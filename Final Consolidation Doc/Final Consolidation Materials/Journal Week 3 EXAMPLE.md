# Introduction 

## Resonances

> We continue to talk about things like the parthenon marbles being returned to greece...once everyone has high density 3D scans of these models...what is the meaning of the actual object if it's already been reproduced? How do we connect ownership with the proliferation of digital copies and the ability of digital copies...to kind of move seamlessly around the world?
	
	This made me think about how technologies such as Blockchain and NFT's (non fungible tokens) may be used to restore a sense of ownership and authenticity to digital copies. 

## Response to the Prompts

discuss your observations about the graveyard you are working on. Are there differences in who gets commemorated, and how? Were there aspects of the work that affected you emotionally? Why? Do the 3d models have an affective aura? Why or why not? In what ways does mapping the graveyard give you authority and power? Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you: you don’t have to explain why, but you might select something that is personally meaningful, or leaves you confused, or makes you happy, or intrigues you to know more… etc. Put your journal entry in your repo.

+ After logging the grave of a 6 year old girl named Taylor Maria Adams, I could not help but feel emotional. Taylor Maria Adams was born in 1999 (The same year as my Fiance) and passed away in 2006 at the age of 6. A couple weeks ago on the morning of my sons first birthday, my baby cousin Parker Douglas Sheahan lost his life to sarcoma at the age of 5. Exactly one year to the day earlier, my son was born and Parker had his leg amputated. Although all these events are seperate, they strangely feel connected by a thread of humanity. Although I never knew Taylor Maria Adams, I can't help feeling grief and pain for her and her family. If she had lived on she would be the same age as me and my Fiance today. This affects me not only because she died young, not only because I have a young child myself, or even that I recently lost someone of a similar age, but because I feel I know the world that she would have grown up in. When it comes to graves that are a century or more old, I am not affected the same way. Though it doesn't make sense logically, for some reason it is easier to think of deaths that occured a long time ago as more "okay" because those people had to die eventually.. they would never live to be 200 years old and see the world today. Even scarier, is that one day Taylor Maria Adams and my cousin Parker Douglas Sheahan will be one of those people that werent going to live to be 200 anyway. I guess this is why we have memorials to the dead... as it was said in the podcast. "surely that is part of what a memorial to the departed is meant to acheive, to make you feel something." 


+ discuss your observations about the graveyard you are working on. Are there differences in who gets commemorated, and how? 
	+ In my graveyard, I have not been able to discern any common factors or differences that determine who gets commemorated and how, however I would be interested to revisit that question once we have the ability to manipulate the data we have recorded. Beyond the scope of my graveyard, this question makes me think of the article *Negotiating memory: funerary commemoration as social change in emancipation-era Barbados* by Katherine Cook. Cook discusses how the effects of slavery in 17th to 19th century Barbados have manifested within burial grounds. Cook cites the following to demonstrate a slave owners stance on the conversion of slaves to christianity: 
	
	"being once a Christian, he could no more account him a Slave, and so lose the hold they had of them as Slaves, by making them Christians; and by that means should open such a gap, as all the Planters in the Island would curse him."

	+ Since It would no longer be "ethical" (using this term really loosely here to frame the slaveowners argument) to have a Christian as a slave, slaves were actively prevented from converting to christianity. This then manifested within their burial practices as being a christian was required for being buried within the anglican church. For the sake of keeping this reflection a digestable size, I wont elaborate on how this also ties in to cultual identity and scholarship but I did find those ideas interesting as well.
